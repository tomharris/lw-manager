# lw-manager — conventions and invariants

Last War automation and alliance analytics platform. The architectural thesis:
**the bot is the collection tier for the analytics tier.** A bot that can
navigate to Alliance → Members → VS Ranking can screenshot those screens on a
schedule and feed the parser directly.

Full design: `docs/lastwar-platform-design.gen`.
Current milestone spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/`.

## Quickstart

```bash
docker compose up -d          # postgres on :5433, minio on :9000
make build                    # bin/agent, bin/control
./bin/control migrate

# with an emulator running and `adb devices` listing it:
./bin/agent devices                                  # confirm the probe works
./bin/agent register --nickname myalt --role alliance_data
./bin/agent capture --account <id printed above>
./bin/agent accounts                                 # what is registered
```

`register` probes the device over adb rather than taking a resolution flag:
registration is the one cheap moment to prove the serial is real and the
device is reachable. It is idempotent, so re-running it corrects a typo
instead of creating a duplicate account.

## Invariants — non-negotiable

1. **No absolute pixel coordinates outside a `Transport` implementation.**
   Everything upstream speaks `transport.Norm` (both components in `[0,1]`).
   `Norm.Pixels` is the only sanctioned denormalization point.
2. **Every task is idempotent and interruptible.** Assume the process is
   killed at any step. Re-running a half-finished task must be safe.
3. **No task acts without a matched screen anchor first.** Blind taps are a
   bug, not a shortcut.
4. **Facts are append-only.** Corrections supersede via `superseded_by`;
   nothing is mutated in place. Every number must trace back to a screenshot.
5. **Every OCR-derived number carries a confidence and a screenshot reference.**
   Low-confidence reads go to the review queue, never to a leaderboard.
6. **All vision logic ships with fixture-based tests that run with no device
   attached.** `go test ./...` must pass with no emulator, no adb, no Docker.
7. **Sleeps go through the jittered context helper.** Never bare `time.Sleep`
   in task code — fixed timing is the most detectable signal we emit.
8. **The kill switch is checked between every task step.** Global `PAUSE_ALL`
   and per-account `enabled`. You will need to stop everything in five seconds
   during an alliance event.

## Go conventions

- **`CGO_ENABLED=0`, always.** Enforced by the Makefile and `make verify-nocgo`.
  This rules out gocv, gosseract, and onnxruntime_go. It is a deliberate
  trade: OCR goes through the `tesseract` CLI as a subprocess, and template
  matching is a hand-rolled NCC implementation.
- `context.Context` is the first parameter of anything that does I/O.
- Wrap errors with `%w` and enough context to locate the failure without a
  stack trace: which device, which account, which key.
- All output goes through `log/slog` to **stderr**. CLI results go to stdout
  so they stay pipeable.
- Sentinel errors (`ErrNotFound`, `ErrOutOfRange`, `ErrAccountDisabled`) are
  compared with `errors.Is`/`errors.As`, never by string.

## Testing

- `make test` — unit tests. **Must pass with nothing running.** Fakes:
  `transport.ReplayTransport`, `blob.FSStore`, and package-local store fakes.
- `make test-integration` — needs `docker compose up -d`. Tagged
  `//go:build integration`.
- `make test-device` — needs an emulator or handset on adb. Tagged
  `//go:build device`, kept separate from `integration` because the
  infrastructure differs: adb, not Docker. Skips when no device is attached.
  This is the only place `ADBTransport` is exercised for real.
- New packages get a fake or a replay path before they get a real
  implementation. `ReplayTransport` was written before `ADBTransport` was
  trusted, and that ordering is the pattern to follow.

### ReplayTransport exhaustion

Holds its last frame once fixtures run out, but caps total serves
(`DefaultMaxServes`). Holding lets poll-until-recognized loops settle like a
real idle device; the cap makes a non-converging task fail fast rather than
hang the suite. Override per-test with `rt.MaxServes`.

## Layout

```
cmd/control     API, scheduler, migrations
cmd/agent       device driver CLI
internal/config env-driven config; malformed values fail loudly
internal/db     schema, embedded migrations, hand-written pgx queries
internal/blob   content-addressed object store (fs + s3 backends)
internal/transport  Transport interface; adb.go, replay.go
internal/capture    screenshot -> blob -> db
fixtures/       recorded screenshots for device-free tests
```

## Gotchas

- **`adb exec-out`, never `adb shell`, for `screencap`.** `shell` applies CRLF
  translation that corrupts binary PNG output. Exits 0 while doing it.
- **Postgres is on host port 5433**, not 5432 — 5432 is commonly already
  allocated by another project.
- Identical screenshot bytes deduplicate to **one blob but still write a
  separate `screenshots` row**. Each capture is a distinct observation;
  collapsing rows would silently under-report participation.

## Operational reality

Automation of this kind violates Last War's ToS and accounts can be banned.
Run alts, not a main. Humanize timing. Keep the kill switch working.
